Welcome to my public profile!

I'm currently engaged in finishing the journey through the [Learn Enough to Be Dangerous](https://www.learnenough.com) website.  
This journey consists of 10 tutorials on basic to advanced skills necessary for consistent web developing and finalizes with the acclaimed [Ruby on Rails Tutorial](https://www.learnenough.com/course/ruby_on_rails_tutorial_7th_edition) from the author [Michael Hartl](https://www.michaelhartl.com).
